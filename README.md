# Usage
To embed a Github Gist snippet or OpenGist, add a new code block:

<br />

## Github Gist

````shell
```gistr
https://gist.github.com/username/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
gist.github.com/username/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
````

<br />

This plugin can also fetch a Gist which contains multiple notes in a single gist collection:

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/062f2dc0-c14a-4d4f-a3e0-5358458a528a"></p>

<br />

If your gist contains multiple files, you may  target a specific note inside a gist, append `#filename` to the end of your gist url:

````shell
```gistr
https://gist.github.com/Aetherinox/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx#file1
```
````

<br />

If you do not target a specific file on a gist which contains multiple files, all files with that matching URL will be displayed on top of each other.

<br />

Despite whatever theme you have selected in the Gistr settings, you can force a gist note to use a specific theme by appending `&themename` to the end of the url

<br />

**Theme Options:**
- `dark`
- `light`

<br />

````shell
```gistr
https://gist.github.com/Aetherinox/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&dark
```
````

<br />

<br />

## OpenGist
Showing gists from your OpenGist server work in a similar manner to Github. To display gists from OpenGist, create a new codeblock and add your gist URL:

<br />

````shell
```gistr
https://gist.yourdomain.com/username/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
gist.yourdomain.com/username/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
````

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="Docs/images/3.png"></p>

<br />

To force a specific theme, append `&themename` at the end of the url

<br />

**Theme Options:**
- `dark`
- `light`

<br />

```shell
https://gist.yourdomain.com/Username/Gist_ID&light
https://gist.yourdomain.com/Username/Gist_ID&dark
```

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/89283b6f-474c-40c5-b008-2966f506e9e1"></p>

# OpenGist - How It Works
The following explains the procedure behind this plugin and OpenGist.

As of v1.6.0, [OpenGist](https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist) includes a feature which works much like Github. Every time you upload a new gist to your OpenGist website, you can view that gist normally by going to the associated link:

```
https://gist.yourdomain.com/username/000abcdef1234567abcdef1234567abc
```

<br />

With OpenGist, you may now fetch `JSON` information about a gist, and include your gist in outside programs such as Obsidian.md.

<br />

To manually view the JSON, HTML, Javascript, and CSS feeds for each of your OpenGists, append `.json` to the end of your URL:

```
https://gist.yourdomain.com/username/000abcdef1234567abcdef1234567abc.json
```

<br />

You will be presented with JSON which defines the values associated to your created gist:

```json
{
  "created_at": "2023-09-24T00:00:000",
  "description": "Opengist Demo Paste",
  "embed": {
    "css": "https://gist.domain.com/assets/embed-abcde123.css",

# Shoutouts
- [thomiceli](https://github.com/thomiceli)  over at [OpenGist](https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist) for implementing the JSON functionality request.
- [linjunpop](https://github.com/linjunpop) for developing the first Obsidian [Gist](https://github.com/linjunpop/obsidian-gist) plugin. It was a top choice in my list of plugins used.
