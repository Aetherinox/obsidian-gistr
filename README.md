# About
The following is an outline of what Gistr can do for you:

<br />

**Supported Services**:
- [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com)

<br />

**Themes**:
- Includes **Light** & **Dark** mode for both services
- Ability to customize individual colors
- CSS stylesheet override
- Thin and customizable scrollbar
- Force theme on each individual gist paste

<br />

**Functionality**:
- Supports embedding Gist mermaid graphs
- Integrated a secondary method of viewing gists which makes gists appear in a frame which acts as a browser window. Allows you to read gists, as well as sign into Github or Opengist and edit your owned gists.
  - `raw` mode supports the ability to specify additional properties:
    - `zoom`
    - `height`
- Save notes from Obsidian as public or secret gists
  - Choose when you want to save a gist, or enable autosave to track changes
  - Requires Github [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) (free). Open Gistr settings in Obsidian to configure.
- Line numbering
- Open embedded Github Gist or Opengist snippets from your notes in your browser
- Filter out specific snippets from a gist which contain multiple files
- Enable / Disable text wrapping and horizontal scrollbar
- Auto-refresh any edits to your settings in reading mode
- Complete customization, including changing the keyword that triggers a codeblock to show gists.

# Features
This section gives a brief explanation of what Gistr can do. Please note that the list below is very minimal and does not cover everything the plugin can do. To view a full feature list; read the documentation:

- [Docs: Basic Usage](https://aetherinox.github.io/obsidian-gistr/usage/basic/)
- [Docs: Properties List](https://aetherinox.github.io/obsidian-gistr/usage/properties/)

<br />

## Methods:
As of version `1.6.0`, Gistr now includes **two** ways to integrate gists into your obsidian.md notes.

- Method 1: [Codeblocks](#method-1-codeblock)
- Method 2: [Integrated Browser](#method-2-integrated-browser)

<br />

### Method 1: Codeblock
This option displays gists in a codeblock with line numbers, and the text of the gist.

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/0670cb0c-56d7-4495-8ee2-9776ec9befca"></p>

<br /><br />

### Method 2: Integrated Browser
This option displays gists in a browser-like environment. This method allows you to sign into Github and view, or edit your gists.

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/a1104ae2-00b5-4835-97f5-9edd51f39f6e"></p>

<br />
<br />

## Convert Note to Gist:
This feature allows you to take notes currently in Obsidian and convert them over to gists which will be hosted on services like Github.

<br />

After writing your note in Obsidian, right-click anywhere in your note and select **Save Gist** as either a public or secret note.

<br />

If you have a note as an existing gist saved, Gistr will confirm you wanting to save your gist by listing it in the suggestion box.  Click the note name to push your changes.

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/d787bb1c-1179-4293-bf67-d2bc3dbf0e5b"></p>

<br />

To convert your notes into gists, you must register for a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) on Github.

<br />

---

<br />

# Usage
To embed a Github Gist snippet or OpenGist, add a new code block:

<br />

## Github Gist

````shell
```gistr
url:    https://gist.github.com/username/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
````

<br />

This plugin can also fetch a Gist which contains multiple notes in a single gist collection:

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/062f2dc0-c14a-4d4f-a3e0-5358458a528a"></p>

<br />

If your gist contains multiple files, you may  target a specific note inside a gist, append `#filename` to the end of your gist url:

````shell
```gistr
url:    https://gist.github.com/Aetherinox/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
file:   file1
```
````

<br />

If you do not target a specific file on a gist which contains multiple files, all files with that matching URL will be displayed on top of each other.

<br />

Despite whatever theme you have selected in the Gistr settings, you can force a gist note to use a specific theme by appending `&themename` to the end of the url

<br />

**Theme Options:**
- `dark`
- `light`

<br />

````shell
```gistr
url:    https://gist.github.com/Aetherinox/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
theme:  dark
```
````

<br />

<br />

## OpenGist
Showing gists from your OpenGist server work in a similar manner to Github. To display gists from OpenGist, create a new codeblock and add your gist URL:

<br />

````shell
```gistr
url:    https://gist.yourdomain.com/username/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
````

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/3e396b9f-7b31-4e9c-8557-2d6276c9afaa"></p>

<br />

You may also force an individual gist to use a specific theme:

<br />

**Theme Options:**
- `dark`
- `light`

<br />

```shell
url:    https://gist.yourdomain.com/Username/Gist_ID
theme:  light
```

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 85%;text-align: center;border: 1px solid #353535;" src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-gistr/assets/118329232/89283b6f-474c-40c5-b008-2966f506e9e1"></p>

<br />

To use Opengist, you must install the program on your system as a service, or you can rent a web server. To view a demo of Opengist, as well as full documentation; visit the links below:

# Build

<br />

# OpenGist - How It Works
The following explains the procedure behind this plugin and OpenGist.

As of v1.6.0, [OpenGist](https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist) includes a feature which works much like Github. Every time you upload a new gist to your OpenGist website, you can view that gist normally by going to the associated link:

```
https://gist.yourdomain.com/username/000abcdef1234567abcdef1234567abc
```

<br />

With OpenGist, you may now fetch `JSON` information about a gist, and include your gist in outside programs such as Obsidian.md.

<br />

To manually view the JSON, HTML, Javascript, and CSS feeds for each of your OpenGists, append `.json` to the end of your URL:

```
https://gist.yourdomain.com/username/000abcdef1234567abcdef1234567abc.json
```

<br />

You will be presented with JSON which defines the values associated to your created gist:

```json
{
  "created_at": "2023-09-24T00:00:000",
  "description": "Opengist Demo Paste",

# Shoutouts
- [thomiceli](https://github.com/thomiceli)  over at [OpenGist](https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist) for implementing the JSON functionality request.
- [linjunpop](https://github.com/linjunpop) for developing the first Obsidian [Gist](https://github.com/linjunpop/obsidian-gist) plugin. It was a top choice in my list of plugins used.
