The following examples show you how to integrate an OpenGist snippet into your notes.

## Single Gist
This is a single note specified by the base URL associated with your Github Gist snippet.
```gistr
https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/0f0cafd0b9474041a228dc2d41e86946
```



---


## Multiple Gists
This example shows a gist which has multiple files associated to it.

```gistr
https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/51ea8c19c4ce4df586372abd91af6bb2
```

## Multiple Gist (Select)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, OpenGIst does not support picking out a particular file from a gist that hosts multiple. I am working with the developer to integrate this feature.

## Specify Theme
With this example, despite what theme you have selected in Gistr's settings for a theme, you can override that theme selection for one particular gist by appending `#light` or `#dark` to the URL.

### Light
You can use the light theme by appending `#light` to the end of your URL.
IE: `https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/0f0cafd0b9474041a228dc2d41e86946#light`
```gistr
https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/0f0cafd0b9474041a228dc2d41e86946#light
```


### Dark
You can use the dark theme by appending `#dark` to the end of your URL.
IE: `https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/0f0cafd0b9474041a228dc2d41e86946#dark`
```gistr
https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/0f0cafd0b9474041a228dc2d41e86946#dark
```

## Gist Error
This will display when the URL you have specified is invalid.
```gistr
