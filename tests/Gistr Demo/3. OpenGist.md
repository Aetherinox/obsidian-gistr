## What is OpenGist?
[OpenGist](https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist) is a self-hosted solution that works in a similar manner to Github Gists, but with the added bonus that you control the entire site. It is great for private gist hosting, and also supports other users being able to register on your site and host their own gists. It also includes its own API, and is compatible with [Github CLI (command-line)](https://cli.github.com/)

This guide will not go into detailed instructions on how to install and configure an OpenGist server, however, you can use the buttons below for a very detailed set of instructions for getting started with your own self-hosted gist solution.

OpenGist currently supports hosting your own gist server on

- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

## Using Gistr with OpenGist (Examples)
The following examples show you how to integrate an OpenGist snippet into your notes.

### Single Gist
This is a single note specified by the base URL associated with your Github Gist snippet.

### Multiple Gist (Select One)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, OpenGIst does not support picking out a particular file from a gist that hosts multiple. I am working with the developer to integrate this feature.


### Theme Override
In the `Gistr Settings` tab, you can select which theme you wish to use
- Light
- Dark

However, if you wish to force a particular theme for only one gist, you can append `&themename` on the end of your gist url. Replacing `themename` with either `dark` or `light`.

#### Light
You can use the light theme by appending `&light` to the end of your URL.
IE: `https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/0f0cafd0b9474041a228dc2d41e86946&light`


````
```gistr
url:    https://demo.opengist.io/Aetherinox/0f0cafd0b9474041a228dc2d41e86946
theme:  light
```
