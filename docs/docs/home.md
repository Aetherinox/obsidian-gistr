Gistr is a plugin built for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) which fully integrates [Github](https://github.com) and [Opengist](https://opengist.thomice.li/) snippets directly into your Obsidian notes. With not only full support for **Light** and **Dark** themes; you can also customize how your embedded gists look and perform depending on your specific needs. Gistr also includes a full suite of features which allow you to transfer your Obsidian notes over to the above listed gist services and sync notes with gists, either by manually saving, or setting them up to auto-save with your own specified duration.

<br />

**Supported Services**:

- [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com)
- [OpenGist Server](https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist)
